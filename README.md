# My_work_towards_Opencv
OpenCv (open source computer vision library) is a library of programming function mainly aimed at real time computer vision
OpenCV stands for open-source computer vision. It was generated to support a common infrastructure for computer vision operations and use system behaviour in financial products. It generally targets image processing, faces recognition, video capture, searching, and object disclosure.

OpenCV is created to implement various operations including recognising and detecting faces, analysing human tasks in videos, identifying objects, recording camera movements, tracking moving objects, and combining images to create a high-resolution image for the accurate scene.
